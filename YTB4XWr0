International responsibilities
Physics
LHCb convenor of the ‘QCD, Electroweak, and Exotica’ working group
I co-supervise a working group with around 30 active analyses within the LHCb collab- oration. This important collaborative managerial role answers directly to the physics coordinator of the experiment. It is an essential role in keeping the analyses on track.

I am responsible for maximising the physics output of the group while maintaining the highest possible quality. I oversees the working group covering all LHCb activities related to direct searches of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) signal (e.g. direct Dark Matter searches) together with electroweak and QCD precision measurements of SM quantities (e.g. the W mass measurement).
LHC wide co-convenor of the ‘long-lived particles working group’
The group consists of a small number of physicists selected among the LHC wide pool of experts on the subject. Our role is to advice the physics coordinators of the different LHC experiments in all matters related to long-lived particles. The group is also tasked with producing white papers and targeted documents. Various workshops and topical sessions are also organised. For example, I lead the work related to sterile neutrinos. In this role I organise recurring meetings, harmonise as much as possible the work on simulation, supervise a forum to discuss reinterpretation issues, and lead the discussion related to triggering.
LHCb convenor of the ‘Exotica and Higgs physics’ sub-working group
Technical
Member of the LHCb Operations planning group
The group consists of a small selection of physicists that plan the necessary operational steps to ensure a smooth functioning of the experiment. My expertise is related to data taking and processing and the accessibility of legacy data.
LHCb project-leader of the central offline selection of data
I am responsible for the central pre-selection of all physics analyses of the collaboration for Run 1 & 2. This process, internally called “stripping”, acts essentially as the last stage of the trigger. It is the only way that an analyst has to access centrally stored data and it is conducted in biyearly “campaigns’. In this major role I coordinate the work of around 20 people to serve the entire collaboration (∼ 1500 people) with centrally pre-selected data. I am also responsible for preparing the specification, design, and implementation of future deployments. I report directly to the operation coordinator of the experiment.
LHCb co-coordinator of the offline Data Processing & Analysis working group
This role’s primary tasks are related to the operations, maintaining, and enhancing of the legacy software. I also offer support and guidance to the users interested in Run 1 & 2 data. I directly report to the LHCb computing leader.
LHCb editorial board technical coordinator
I am responsible for the technical aspects of the editorial work (e.g. software tools, analysis life-cycle, LATEX templates). I am also responsible for the public pages of the collaboration and the maintenance and development of its central database.

Scientific output: publications
As a member of the LHCb, SHiP, and SND@LHC collaborations for several years, I am the author of more than 400 publications, with more than 16 000 citations and a h-index index of 59 (all metrics are for published, excluding self-citations). A complete and dynamic list is available on iNSPIRE. Due to the difficulty to evaluate the individual work of a physicist, measures on assessing individual researchers in large collaborations have been established in a memorandum jointly written by the High Energy and Particle Physics division of the European Physical Society (HEPP-EPS) and the European Committee for Future Accelerators (ECFA). In summary the suggestion is not to focus on journal rankings, but to evaluate the visibility of individuals inside their collaborations, their participation in committees and boards as members and as individuals, their presentations at international conferences, their invitations to seminars and colloquia, letters of recommendation, etc. The document can be found online. It is also matter of debate whether or not considering as “significant contribution” to a collaboration paper the review work when being member of an Analysis Review Committee or as convener of an analysis (sub-)working group (I have been a (sub)convener since 2019). I have decided not to single out these papers. A selection of the 12 most relevant articles is outlined below. The 5 articles that I consider the most important are highlighted and a brief explanation of my responsibilities is given.

I led the work on the triggering algorithms. I led the implementation of the material vetoing. I have also performed other studies related to background production. I also conducted detailed studies of the detector response in the case of single muon triggering. Finally I discovered and led collaboration wide discussion on a bug in part of the simulation of the detector.

I was the leader of the team that worked on the validation and deployment of the simulation framework for the whole collaboration. I have also worked on the active muon shied and the simulation of background. The standards of quality in this work has set the benchmark for what concerns background studies for all proposed new experiments at the CERN North Area. It was the seminal paper that started what is now a large number of experimental proposal for a new detector at the SPS.

My work concerns large part of this document. I lead the work on simulation of signal and background processes. My work also concerns the studies related to algorithms for tracks reconstruction. In this respect the development and validation of the missing mass technique was a major part. This technique is necessary to work with τ leptons in an experiment like LHCb. This is a seminal work for the field of lepton flavour universality and one of the most cited papers of the LHCb collaboration.
